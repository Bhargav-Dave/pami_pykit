# PAMI_PyKit

PAMI_PyKit stands for PAttern MIning  Python Kit, which contains a set of python libraries to discover user interest-based patterns in very large databases. The python programs in this kit are organized in the following three topics.

1. Native sequential algorithms - traditional pattern mining algorithms whose input exists in the form of transactional databases (or files).
2. DataFrame sequential algorithms - Native sequential algorithms are modified to accept dataframes as input. These algorithms can be exported to other softwares like Azure. (**under construction**)
3. Native parallel algorithms - We provide algorithms for finding patterns in Map-Reduce framework.


Procedure for the creation of files:

Pami_pykit/(nativeSequential/dataFrame/nativeParallel)/PatternModel/Algorithm

E.g. pami_pykit/nativeSequential/FrequentPatternMining/FPgrowth
