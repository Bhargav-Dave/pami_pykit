# pami_pykit

pami_pykit stands for PAttern MIning  python kit, which contains a set of python libraries to discover user interest-based patterns in the data. The python programs in this toolkit belong to one of the following three topics.

1. Native sequential algorithms - traditional pattern mining algorithms whose input exists in the form of transactional databases (or files).
2. DataFrame sequential algorithms - Native sequential algorithms are modified to accept dataframes as input. These algorithms can be exported to other softwares like Azure.
3. Native parallel algorithms - We provide algorithms for finding patterns in Map-Reduce framework.


Procedure for the creation of files:

Pami_pykit/<nativeSequential/dataFrame/nativeParallel>/PatternModel/Algorithm

E.g. pami_pykit/nativeSequential/FrequentPatternMining/FPgrowth
