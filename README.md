# PAMI_PyKit

PAMI_PyKit stands for PAttern MIning  Python Kit. It contains a set of python libraries to discover user interest-based patterns in very large databases. The python programs in this kit are organized in the following three topics.

1.  Sequential algorithms - traditional pattern mining algorithms whose input exists in the form of transactional databases (or files).
2. DataFrame sequential algorithms - Sequential algorithms are modified to accept dataframes as input. These algorithms can be exported to other softwares like Azure. (**under construction**)
3. Parallel algorithms - Parallel pattern mining algorithms based on Map-Reduce framework.
