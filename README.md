# PAMI_PyKit

PAMI_PyKit stands for PAttern MIning  Python Kit. It contains a set of python libraries to discover user interest-based patterns in very large databases. The python programs in this kit are organized in the following topics:

1.  Traditional algorithms - Conventional algorithms whose input exists in the form of transactional databases (or files).

2. Parallel algorithms - Parallel pattern mining algorithms based on Map-Reduce framework.
